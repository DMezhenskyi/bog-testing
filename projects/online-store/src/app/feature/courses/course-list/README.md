You've got a component `course-list.component.ts`. Component utilizes the service you tested in the previous step in order to fetch data from the server. The fetched data has to be rendered using ngFor loop.

## Task 1 (together)

Try to identify scenarios that are handled in component / create a testing plan.

## Task 2

Setup the `TestBed` for the testing. Think which dependencies have to be mocked/stubbed and which ones could be used directly.

## Task 3

Implement test cases to cover your testing plan defined in Task 1
