You've got a standalone component `Chip`. Apply knowledge about `TestBed.createComponent`, `fixture`, and `debugElement` in order to write unit tests for this component.

## Task 1

Discuss and come up with a testing plan. Write your expectations as a list or create 'placeholder' tests for each scenario.

## Task 2

Implement test cases from your testing plan.
HINT: `EventEmitter` is actually the extension of the RxJS `Subject`, so you can subscribe to it to get the emitted value which eventually will be used inside the expectations.

## Task 3 (discussion) How to make tests less fragile.

## Task 4 (together) - Introducing the TestHost approach.
